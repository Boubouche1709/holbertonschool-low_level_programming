## 📝 Project Description

This C project is focused on implementing and manipulating **singly linked lists** using a custom data structure.
The goal is to understand how dynamic data structures work, how memory is allocated and freed manually, and when it's beneficial to use a linked list over an array.

You will learn how to:
- Create and manage a `list_t` structure
- Add elements at the beginning and end of a list
- Traverse, count, and free list nodes
- Respect low-level constraints on memory and C standard usage

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain — without Google — the following concepts:

- When and why to use **linked lists** vs **arrays**
- How to build, traverse, and free a singly linked list
- How to manage memory safely in C
- How to follow strict coding standards

---

## 🛠 Requirements

### ✅ General Rules

- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Compiler**: `gcc` with the following flags:
  ```bash
  -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
