# 📁 C - File I/O

## 📝 Project Overview

This project teaches how to handle files in C using system calls such as `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, and `dprintf`. You’ll explore low-level file operations without relying on standard library functions like `fopen`. The goal is to deepen your understanding of file descriptors, Unix permissions, and basic I/O in a Linux environment.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Find reliable resources to solve coding problems
- Create, read, write, and close files using system calls
- Understand file descriptors and how they work
- Use flags like `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`, etc.
- Set file permissions using `mode_t` during file creation
- Explain what a system call is versus a regular function
- Follow strict coding conventions, including the Betty style

## 📚 Resources
